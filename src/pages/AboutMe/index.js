            <p>
             Hello, my name is Joel Cupeles and I am 24 years old. I was born and raised in Puerto Rico, where I earned my bachelor's degree in Finance from the University of Puerto Rico. I am passionate about finding innovative solutions to challenges and exceeding expectations. This is why I am currently enrolled in the Washington University web development bootcamp - to expand my creative thinking and to challenge myself further.</p>
            <p>I am proficient in multiple web development languages and I have a strong command of both English and Spanish. No matter how difficult the task may be, I am confident in my ability to complete it to the best of my ability.</p>
